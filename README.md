# Group 4 Project 3 - Comparing Sorting Efficiency for Large Datasets
## By Gabriel Burger, Michael Ramsamooj, Paulina Gonzalez-Brito

### Overview
This project focuses on comparing the efficiency of two sorting algorithms (out of 4 total) when applied to large datasets. The aim is to determine which algorithm performs faster with large datasets.

### Repository Structure
- `04B_20__.TTF` - Font file used in the frontend.
- `frontend.py` - Main program that runs the sorting comparison, including the graphical user interface.
- `main.py` - Contains the implementation of the sorting algorithms.
- `test.py` - Used for testing the sorting algorithms and their performance.
### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- `Python 3.x`
- `Pygame`

A valid dataset is also needed. The `frontend.py` file can be modified to handle a specific column in a CSV file for the data used.
#### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/gburger5/COP3530-Project3.git
```
#### Installing Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd COP3530-Project3
pip install pygame
```
#### Running the Program
To run the program, execute the following command:

```
python frontend.py
```
This will launch the graphical user interface, allowing you to compare the sorting efficiency of the implemented algorithms.

### Usage
1. Launch the program using the command above.
2. Select the sorting algorithms you wish to compare.
3. Start the comparison to see the results displayed on the screen.
